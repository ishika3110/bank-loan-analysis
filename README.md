# Bank Loan Report Dashboard – Power BI

This project is a comprehensive, interactive dashboard built using Power BI to visualize and analyze a bank’s loan portfolio performance. The dashboard helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions by providing clear insights into loan application trends, funding performance, repayment behavior, and borrower segmentation.

## 📌 Project Overview

The dashboard is divided into three main layers:

- **Summary Dashboard**: Key KPIs including total loan applications, funded amount, amount received, average interest rate, and average debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Also features Good vs Bad loan classification.
  
- **Overview Dashboard**: Visualizations covering monthly trends, regional performance (state-wise), loan terms, employment length, loan purposes, and home ownership.

- **Details Dashboard**: A complete loan-level breakdown with filters for in-depth analysis across borrower and loan attributes.
